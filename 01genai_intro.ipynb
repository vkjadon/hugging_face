            "1.  **P (Proportional) - The \"React Now\" Brain:**\n",
            "    *   **How it works:** This brain looks at how far away you currently are from your target (the \"error\"). The *bigger* the error, the *bigger* its immediate reaction.\n",
            "    *   **Shower Analogy:** If your shower is freezing cold (big error), you'd crank the hot water knob hard. As it gets closer to warm, you'd ease off the knob.\n",
            "    *   **Problem with just P:** It's good for quick reactions, but it often can't hit the target *perfectly*. It might get you 90% there, but then leave a small, persistent \"offset\" error (e.g., the shower is *almost* warm enough, but not quite, because if it *were* perfect, P would give no output).\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **I (Integral) - The \"Correct for Past Mistakes\" Brain:**\n",
            "    *   **How it works:** This brain \"remembers\" how long you've been off target and by how much. If there's a small, persistent error (the offset from P), it keeps adding a little extra corrective action over time until that error completely disappears.\n",
            "    *   **Shower Analogy:** The shower is *still* slightly cool after a minute (that small offset error). So, you *gradually* turn the hot water knob a tiny bit more, patiently waiting until it's just right.\n",
            "    *   **Benefit:** Eliminates those persistent offset errors that P alone can't fix.\n",
            "    *   **Problem with just I (or too much I):** Can cause \"overshoot\" (you turn the knob too much because you were waiting so long, and now the water is too hot) and \"wind-up\" (it builds up too much corrective action).\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **D (Derivative) - The \"Anticipate the Future\" Brain:**\n",
            "    *   **How it works:** This brain looks at how *fast* the error is changing. It tries to predict what will happen next and acts *before* it happens.\n",
            "    *   **Shower Analogy:** You see the water temperature suddenly *rising very quickly*. You anticipate it will overshoot and become scalding hot, so you quickly turn down the hot water *before* it actually gets too hot. Or, if it's dropping quickly, you add more hot water *before* it gets too cold.\n",
            "    *   **Benefit:** Helps to stabilize the system, prevents overshoot, and makes the system react more smoothly and quickly without oscillating wildly.\n",
            "    *   **Problem with just D (or too much D):** Can make the system jumpy and amplify noise, as it reacts to every tiny change.\n",
